# 🎨 Simple Publisher v0.2.0 - The "Creative" Update

This update introduces powerful image manipulation tools, efficient file storage, and workflow improvements.

## ✨ New Features

### 📸 Image Filters & Effects
Edit your images directly within Simple Publisher!
*   **Presets**: Instantly apply **Black & White**, **Sepia**, or **Vintage** effects.
*   **Adjustments**: Fine-tune **Brightness**, **Contrast**, and **Blur** with real-time sliders.
*   **Color Tinting**: Colorize any image with a custom color (Duotone effect) and adjustable opacity.

### 💾 Performance & Storage
*   **Compressed Projects**: `.spao` files are now **GZIP compressed**, reducing file size by up to 90% while keeping all assets embedded.

### 🖌️ Style Manager
*   **Copy/Paste Styles**: Easily copy the look (color, stroke, shadow, font) of one object and apply it to another.

### 📐 UI Improvements
*   **Toolbar Reorganized**: Text tools are now intuitively placed directly below the Selection tool for faster access.
*   **Pages Panel**: Relocated to a collapsible bottom panel for better workspace visibility.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
