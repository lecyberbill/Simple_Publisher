This first minor release brings a massive expansion to the creative capabilities of Simple Publisher with a fully revamped Asset Library and hundreds of new shapes.

## ✨ New Features

### 📚 Expanded Asset Library
*   **Categories**: Shapes are now organized into clear categories: `Geometric`, `Arrows`, `Symbols`, `Flowchart`, and `Decorations`.
*   **Search & Filtering**: You can now filter assets by category or use the search bar to find exactly what you need.
*   **Smart Layout**: The library panel features a responsive grid with wrapping category pills for better navigation.

### 🏹 Complete Arrow Collection
*   Added over **16 new arrow variants** (Thick, Circle, Caret, Chevron).

### 🧩 Integrated Open Iconic
*   **200+ New Icons**: Fully integrated the **Open Iconic** library.
*   **Vector Scalability**: All icons are pure SVGs (path-based), fully editable (color, stroke, size) and scalable without quality loss.
*   **Categorized**: Icons are automatically sorted into `Media`, `Interface`, `Communication`, `Social`, `Weather`, etc.

## 🛠 Improvements
