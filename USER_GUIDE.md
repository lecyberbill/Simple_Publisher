# 📖 User Guide - Simple Publisher

Welcome to **Simple Publisher**! This guide is designed to help you create stunning documents easily, even if you've never used publishing software before.

---

## 🏗 1. Exploring the Interface

The screen is divided into four main areas:

1. **Title Bar (Top)**: This is where you manage your files (New, Open, Save) and where you can Undo or Redo your actions. You'll also find the export buttons (PNG/PDF) here.
2. **Canvas (Center)**: Your "paper." Everything you place here will be visible in your final document.
3. **Toolbar (Left)**: Your "toolbox." This is where you choose what to add: text, shapes, or drawing tools.
4. **Properties Panel (Right)**: When you click on an object (like a text box or a circle), its options appear here: change the color, font, size, and more.

## 🖌 3. Drawing Like an Artist

Simple Publisher offers three ways to draw by hand:

- **Pencil Tool**: For thin, simple strokes.
- **Brush Tool**: For textured effects and patterns (dots, lines, diamonds).
- **Pen Tool (Bezier)**: For creating custom shapes point by point. Double-click a point to turn it into a curve!

### Smart Guides
When you move objects, magenta lines will appear to help you align them with other objects or the center of the page.
- **Magnet Button**: Toggle this feature on/off using the magnet icon in the toolbar.

## 📦 4. Managing Pages
Simple Publisher now supports multi-page documents!
- **Add Page**: Click the **"Add Page"** button at the bottom of the screen.

## 📦 5. Organizing Your Document

### Layers
Imagine your objects are stacked transparent sheets.
- Go to the **Layers** tab on the right.
- You can hide an object (eye icon) or lock it so it doesn't move by mistake (lock icon).

### Grouping Objects
If you've created a logo with several shapes and text:
- Select them all (or press `Ctrl + A`).
- Click the **Group** button at the top.
- Now they move together as one single block!
